# Backup Manager

A Python-based backup system that schedules and performs automated backups from the command line. Create, list, and delete backup schedules, control a background service, and generate compressed `.tar` backup files — all with proper logging and error handling.

## Overview

Backup Manager automates local directory backups by providing a CLI tool (`backup_manager.py`) that manages schedules and a background service (`backup_service.py`) that executes those backups at the scheduled times. It solves the problem of manual, error-prone backups by introducing automation, structured logging, and robust error handling.

---

## Role-play

You have been hired as junior DevOps engineers at a small company. The team currently performs manual backups of important directories, which is error-prone and time-consuming. Your manager has asked you to build an automated backup system that runs in the background, follows a schedule, and logs every action. Your mission is to deliver two Python scripts that work together to manage and execute scheduled backups reliably.

---

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, you will learn to:

- Implement scheduled file operations using Python
- Design a command-line interface that manages a background service
- Build file compression and archiving using the `tarfile` library
- Analyze process management techniques using `subprocess` and `os` modules
- Implement structured logging and error handling with `try` and `except` blocks

## Instructions

### Part 1: backup\_manager.py

This script orchestrates the backup service and manages the file `backup_schedules.txt`. It accepts the following command-line arguments:

#### `create [schedule]`

Add a new backup schedule to `backup_schedules.txt`.

- **Format:** `"path_to_save;HH:MM;backup_name"`
- **Log examples:**
  - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] New schedule added: test2;16:07;office_docs`
  - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Error: malformed schedule: test;`

#### `list`

Print the scheduled backups from `backup_schedules.txt`, with an index before each entry.

- **Log examples:**
  - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Show schedules list`
  - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Error: can't find backup_schedules.txt`

#### `delete [index]`

Delete the backup schedule at the given index (starting at 0) from `backup_schedules.txt`.

- **Log examples:**
  - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Schedule at index 3 deleted`
  - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Error: can't find schedule at index 3`
  - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Error: can't find backup_schedules.txt`

#### `start`

Run `backup_service.py` in the background.

- **Log examples:**
  - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] backup_service started`
  - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Error: backup_service already running`

#### `stop`

Kill the `backup_service.py` process.

- **Log examples:**
  - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] backup_service stopped`
  - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Error: can't stop backup_service`

#### `backups`

List the backup files in `./backups`.

- **Log examples:**
  - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Show backups list`
  - `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm] Error: can't find backups directory`

> All actions and errors from `backup_manager.py` are logged to `./logs/backup_manager.log`.

---

### Part 2: backup\_service.py

This script checks the schedules in `backup_schedules.txt` and performs backups at the scheduled times.

- The service runs in an **infinite loop**.
- During each iteration, the service checks the backup schedules.
- The service performs a backup when the current hour and minute match a scheduled time.
- Schedules whose time has already passed are **removed** from `backup_schedules.txt` after processing.
- Backups are saved as compressed `.tar` files in `./backups`.
- All actions and errors are logged to `./logs/backup_service.log`.
- At the end of each loop iteration, the service **sleeps for ~45 seconds** to save processor cycles.

---

### Part 3: Logging and Error Handling

- All scripts must use `try` and `except` blocks to handle errors.
- All actions and errors are logged to the appropriate file in the `./logs` directory:
  - `backup_manager.py` → `./logs/backup_manager.log`
  - `backup_service.py` → `./logs/backup_service.log`
- Each log entry must start with a timestamp in the format: `[dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm]`
- Unknown or invalid commands must produce an appropriate error log entry.

---

## Usage

```bash
# Create 3 new schedules
python3 ./backup_manager.py create "test;16:07;backup_test"
python3 ./backup_manager.py create "test1;16:07;personal_data"
python3 ./backup_manager.py create "test2;16:07;office_docs"

# Try to add a malformed schedule
python3 ./backup_manager.py create "test;"

# List all schedules
python3 ./backup_manager.py list

# Start and stop the backup service
python3 ./backup_manager.py start
python3 ./backup_manager.py stop

# List completed backups
python3 ./backup_manager.py backups

# Inspect logs
cat ./logs/backup_manager.log
cat ./logs/backup_service.log

# Check backup files
ls ./backups
```

[dd/mm/yyyy 16:07] Backup done for test in backups/backup_test.tar

## Tips

- Use `subprocess.Popen` with `start_new_session=True` to run the backup service in the background.
- Use `os.kill` to stop a process by finding its process ID.
- Use `ps -A -f` to inspect active processes and their arguments during debugging.
- The standard library `tarfile` is very useful for creating `.tar` archives programmatically.
- Keep your code modular by creating single-task functions for each command.
